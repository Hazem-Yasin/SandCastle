//what you might find in an the helper folder: 
//1. Utility Classes: Helper classes often contain static methods that perform common tasks or calculations relevant to the domain logic of the application. These methods are usually stateless and provide functionality such as formatting data, generating unique identifiers, performing conversions, or validating inputs.

//example: 
using System;
using System.Collections;
using static System.Net.Mime.MediaTypeNames;

public static class DateTimeHelper
{
	public static bool IsWeekend(DateTime date)
	{
		return date.DayOfWeek == DayOfWeek.Saturday || date.DayOfWeek == DayOfWeek.Sunday;
	}
}

//2.Helper Methods: Helper methods encapsulate reusable logic that doesn't belong to a specific domain entity or operation but is still essential to the functionality of the application. These methods might handle tasks like logging, error handling, string manipulation, or data transformation.
public class ErrorLogger
{
	public static void LogError(Exception ex)
	{
		Console.WriteLine(ex);
	}
}


//3. Validation Helpers: Sometimes, helper classes include methods for data validation. These methods can validate inputs against certain criteria, such as checking if an email address is valid, ensuring a password meets security requirements, or verifying that a user input is within acceptable bounds.

public static class ValidationHelper
{
	public static bool IsValidEmail(string email)
	{
		if (email == null)
		{
			return false;
		}
		else if (email.Length == 0)
		{
			return false;
		}
	}


	//4. Configuration Helpers: Helper classes may provide methods for accessing configuration settings or managing application settings.These methods abstract away the details of configuration management and provide a clean interface for accessing configuration values.
	public static class ConfigurationHelper
	{
		public static string GetAppSettings(string key)
		{

		}
	}


	//5. Data Access Helpers: In some cases, helper classes might include methods for interacting with the data access layer, encapsulating common data access operations such as querying the database, executing stored procedures, or handling transactions.

	public static class DataAccessHelper
	{
		public static IEnumerable<T> ExcuteQuery<T>(string query)
        {
        }
    }

	//Overall, the helper section in the BLL serves as a repository for reusable functionality that supports the core business logic of the application.By organizing helper classes and methods in a dedicated section, developers can maintain a clean and modular codebase, making it easier to understand, extend, and maintain the business logic layer.
